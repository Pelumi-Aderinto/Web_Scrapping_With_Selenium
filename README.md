# Web_Scrapping_With_Selenium
This repo as at the time of the writing of this readMe file contains two Webscrapping Projects using Selenium;

In the first project, I scrapped a job website ('https://www.jobsite.co.uk/') (A dynamic website) using Selenium along with its webdriver. I scrapped just five pages of the website with each page consisting of  for five fields namely; The Job tile, The company, Salary, Location and Job description.

These scrapped data(as a csv file) alongside the code used can be seen in the same directory(Jobs_data_Scrapping directory). Essentially, this is a project to demonstrate mastery of Selenium as a scrapping tool. More complicated websites can also be scrapped since the basics is understood.

In the second project, I scrapped a website ('https://www.expertise.com/ny/nyc/real-estate-agents') containing details about certain real estate agents. The details that were scrapped include the three fields namely; Realtor name, Location and Phone number.

These scrapped data(as a csv file) alongside the code used can be seen in the same directory(Real_Estate_data_Scrapping directory). Essentially, this is a project to further demonstrate mastery of Selenium and its webdriver as scrapping tools. More complicated websites can also be scrapped since the basics is understood.
