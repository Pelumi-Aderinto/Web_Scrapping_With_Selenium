# Web_Scrapping_With_Selenium
In this project, I scrapped a job website ('https://www.jobsite.co.uk/') (A dynamic website) using Selenium along with its webdriver. I scrapped just five pages of the website with each page consisting of  for five fields namely; The Job tile, The company, Salary, Location and Job description.

These scrapped data can be seen in the csv file in the same directory. Essentially, this is a project to demonstrate mastery of Selenium as a scrapping tool. More complicated websites can also be scrapped since the basics is understood.
